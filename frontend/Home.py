    ### Welcome to Kanta!
    
    Kanta helps you and your guests capture and organize photos from any event. 
    It's like a shared digital camera roll that automatically identifies people and groups their photos together, 
    making it easy to find every moment.

    1.  **Event Setup (Admin)**:
        *   Navigate to **[01 Event Management](01_Event_Management)** to create a new event or manage existing ones. 
        *   Set the event name, description, and duration. You'll get a unique Event Code.

    2.  **Capture & Upload Photos**:
        *   During the event, use the **[02 Camera & Upload](02_Camera_Upload)** page (or share the Event Code with guests for them to upload).
        *   Easily upload photos from your phone or computer, or take new ones directly if your device supports it.

    3.  **Browse & Explore**:
        *   Go to **[03 Image Gallery](03_Image_Gallery)** to see all uploaded photos. Filter by date, number of faces, or specific people.
        *   Download your favorite shots individually or as a batch.

    4.  **Discover People**:
        *   Visit **[04 People & Similarity](04_People_Similarity)** to see who Kanta has automatically identified. 
        *   Select people to view all photos they appear in, or use the similarity search to find someone by uploading an example photo.
