# 7. Accessibility Considerations

  * **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 elements for structure and meaning.
  * **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard.
  * **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive `alt` text for all images.
  * **Color Contrast**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines for color contrast, especially with the retro color palette, to ensure readability.
  * **Focus Management**: Manage focus logically for users navigating with assistive technologies.
