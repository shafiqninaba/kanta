# 2. Visual Design & Aesthetic (`"Disposable Camera Lens" Feel`)

The overall aesthetic will lean heavily into a **retro** and **vintage** feel, reminiscent of classic disposable cameras and analog photography.

  * **Overall Theme/Mood**: Retro, nostalgic, slightly gritty or textured, with a focus on simplicity and functionality that evokes a bygone era.
  * **Color Palette**:
      * `#222831` (Dark Slate - Primary background, deep accents)
      * `#31363F` (Charcoal Grey - Secondary backgrounds, darker elements)
      * `#76ABAE` (Teal Blue - Accent color, interactive elements, highlights)
      * `#EEEEEE` (Light Grey - Text, subtle backgrounds, paper-like elements)
  * **Typography**: A vintage-looking sans-serif font will be selected for headings and primary text, complemented by a mono-spaced or distressed-looking font for numerical displays (e.g., shot counter) and specific retro accents.
  * **Imagery & Icons**: Icons will adopt a clear **retro style**, possibly outlined, hand-drawn, or pixel-art influenced, avoiding modern flat or gradient styles. Visual elements like "lens" borders, film grain overlays, and light leaks will be strategically used to enhance the immersive feel.
  * **Visual Effects**:
      * **Lens Effect**: The primary camera view will feature a subtle **vignetting** effect around the edges, simulating looking through a physical lens. A slight, adjustable **film grain overlay** will be present to enhance the retro feel. The camera feed itself will occupy the center within this framed view.
      * **Flash Effect**: Upon successful photo capture, a brief, bright white overlay animation will flash across the screen, mimicking a camera flash.
      * **Shutter Animation**: When the shutter button is pressed, a quick, mechanical-like animation (e.g., a simulated aperture closing and opening, or a quick black-out) will occur.
