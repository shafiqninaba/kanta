# Development Workflow & Best Practices

  * **Linting & Formatting**: Enforce consistent code style using ESLint and Prettier, integrated into pre-commit hooks (mirroring backend setup).
  * **Testing**: Implement Jest/React Testing Library for unit and integration tests. Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) tests.
  * **CI/CD**: Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions) for automated testing, building, and deployment to a static hosting service or Vercel.
  * **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript throughout the codebase for improved code quality, maintainability, and developer experience.
